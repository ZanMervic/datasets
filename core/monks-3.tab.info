    "description": "Once upon a time, in July 1991, the monks of Corsendonk Priory were faced with a school held in their priory, namely the 2nd European Summer School on Machine Learning. After listening more than one week to a wide variety of learning algorithms, they felt rather confused: Which algorithm would be optimal? And which one to avoid? As a consequence of this dilemma, they created a simple task on which all learning algorithms ought to be compared: the three MONK's problems. The target concept associated with the 3rd Monk's problem is the binary outcome of the logical formula: MONK-3: (a5 = 3 and a4 = 1) or (a5 /= 4 and a2 /= 3). In addition, 5% class noise was added to the training set.",
