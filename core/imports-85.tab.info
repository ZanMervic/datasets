    "description": "This data set includes the specification of cars imported to the US in 1985. The class variable is set to the price of the car but can be changed to other target variables. The data includes three types of entities: (a) the specification of an auto in terms of various characteristics, (b) its assigned insurance risk rating, (c) its normalized losses in use as compared to other cars. The second rating corresponds to the degree to which the auto is riskier than its price indicates. Cars are initially assigned a risk factor symbol associated with its price. Then, if it is more risky (or less), this symbol is adjusted by moving it up (or down) the scale. Actuaries call this process symboling. A value of +3 indicates that the auto is risky, -3 that it is probably pretty safe. ",
