    "description": "A preprocessed sample of Kang et al. (2018) data containing 3,000 randomly sampled control and stimulated cells and 9,827 genes with highest detection count. Expression was CPM-normalized, log-transformed, and z-standardized. In the original study, the multiplexed dscRNA-seq was used to characterize the cell-type specificity and inter-individual variability of response to IFN-\\u03b2, a potent cytokine that induces genome-scale changes in the transcriptional profiles of immune cells. From each of eight lupus patients, PBMCs were activated with recombinant IFN-\\u03b2 or left untreated for 6 h, a time point previously found to maximize the expression of interferon-sensitive genes in dendritic cells and T cells16,17. Two pools, IFN-\\u03b2-treated and control, were prepared with the same number of cells from each individual and loaded onto the 10\\u00d7 Chromium instrument.",
