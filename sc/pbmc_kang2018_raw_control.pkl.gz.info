    "description": "Multiplexed dscRNA-seq was used to characterize the cell-type specificity and inter-individual variability of response to IFN-\u03b2, a potent cytokine that induces genome-scale changes in the transcriptional profiles of immune cells. From each of eight lupus patients, PBMCs were activated with recombinant IFN-\u03b2 or left untreated for 6 h, a time point previously found to maximize the expression of interferon-sensitive genes in dendritic cells and T cells16,17. Two pools, IFN-\u03b2-treated and control, were prepared with the same number of cells from each individual and loaded onto the 10\u00d7 Chromium instrument.",
